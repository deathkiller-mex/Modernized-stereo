# Modernized-stereo
I was gifted an old stereo, and I thought it would be fun to give it an upgrade and a fresh look, so I will add Bluetooth capabilities to an old portable stereo and might give it a new look with a new 3D printed case.

The stereo I will be using has a CD, a cassette, and a radio player. All these features will be left untouched; the only change that I will make is that I will remove the recording option, as the Bluetooth audio will be connected here.
