# Modernized-stereo
I was gifted an old stereo, and I thought it would be fun to give it an upgrade and a fresh look, so I will add Bluetooth capabilities to an old portable stereo and might give it a new look with a new 3D printed case.

The stereo I will be using has a CD, a cassette, and a radio player. All these features will be left untouched; the only change that I will make is that I will remove the recording option, as the Bluetooth audio will be connected here.
TO power everything up, find a place where there are 12V, e.g., on my stereo, there were 2 cables that went from the power supply to the main board. I cut this cable and added two additional cables, which go to my board.

# ⚠⚠WARNING⚠⚠
Some stereos may have an old transformer and some diodes connected after, MAKE SURE TO NOT TOUCH ANYTHING BEFORE THE DIODES WHEN THE STEREO IS ON, OR YOU WILL BE SHOCKED. Additionally, DO NOT CONNECT YOUR BOARD BEFORE, AS THE BOARD WORKS WITH DC CURRENT, AND ANYTHING BEFORE THE DIODES IS AC. IF YOU CONNECT YOUR BOARD HERE, YOU WILL DAMAGE YOUR COMPONENTS!!!
